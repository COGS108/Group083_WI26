    "Sleep plays an essential role in cognition, memory, and learning. Research in neuroscience shows that sleep is an active process during which the brain consolidates newly learned information and strengthens memory. These processes are important for attention, executive function, and long-term learning, all of which are necessary for academic success. When sleep is inadequate or disrupted, these cognitive functions can be impaired, making it more difficult for students to perform well academically (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2762\" target=\"_blank\">Diekelmann & Born, 2010</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "Several empirical studies have examined the relationship between sleep patterns and academic performance in student populations. An in-depth study of medical students found that ongoing sleep deprivation over a three-month period was associated with declines in academic scores, suggesting that reduced sleep may negatively affect academic outcomes (<a href=\"https://www.cureus.com/articles/380070-impact-of-sleep-deprivation-on-cognition-and-academic-scores-a-three-month-longitudinal-study-among-indian-medical-students\" target=\"_blank\">Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Cognition and Academic Scores, Cureus</a>). In addition, research by Gaultney (2017) found that among college students, sleep duration and sleep timing were associated with academic performance measures such as GPA (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10963758.2017.1297713\" target=\"_blank\">Gaultney, 2017</a>). Together, these studies provide evidence that sleep behavior is meaningfully related to academic outcomes, though they differ in how thoroughly they control for other influencing factors. Although the relationship between sleep and academic performance has been studied before, this project does not aim to introduce a new theoretical idea. Instead, it focuses on confirming and extending existing findings using a data science approach and publicly available datasets. Many previous studies do not fully account for prior academic performance, which makes it harder to separate the effect of sleep from a student’s existing ability. By controlling for prior GPA and demographic factors, our analysis examines whether sleep duration remains a meaningful predictor of end-of-semester GPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the specific contribution of sleep to academic success, researchers recommend controlling for prior academic performance and relevant demographic variables. Prior GPA is a strong predictor of future academic outcomes and should be included in analytical models to avoid attributing existing differences in ability to sleep alone. By using regression models that incorporate prior performance and demographic controls, it becomes possible to evaluate whether sleep duration remains a significant predictor of end-of-semester GPA. This project follows that approach by examining the relationship between average nightly sleep duration and semester GPA while accounting for baseline academic performance and demographic factors.\n"

    "We hypothesize that average nightly sleep duration ($TotalSleepTime$) will be a positive and significant predictor of end-of-semester GPA ($term\\_gpa$), such that an increase in sleep duration is associated with higher academic achievement even when controlling for prior performance ($cum\\_gpa$) and demographic factors. This expectation is grounded in the established neurobiological role of sleep in memory consolidation, executive function, and emotional regulation, all of which are critical for the high-level cognitive processing required to succeed in a college environment. By accounting for baseline academic ability and course load, we aim to isolate the specific impact that sleep hygiene has on a student's ability to maintain and improve their grades."

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
