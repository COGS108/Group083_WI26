    "Sleep plays an essential role in cognition, memory, and learning. Research in neuroscience shows that sleep is an active process during which the brain consolidates newly learned information and strengthens memory. These processes are important for attention, executive function, and long-term learning, all of which are necessary for academic success. When sleep is inadequate or disrupted, these cognitive functions can be impaired, making it more difficult for students to perform well academically (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2762\" target=\"_blank\">Diekelmann & Born, 2010</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "Several empirical studies have examined the relationship between sleep patterns and academic performance in student populations. An in-depth study of medical students found that ongoing sleep deprivation over a three-month period was associated with declines in academic scores, suggesting that reduced sleep may negatively affect academic outcomes (<a href=\"https://www.cureus.com/articles/380070-impact-of-sleep-deprivation-on-cognition-and-academic-scores-a-three-month-longitudinal-study-among-indian-medical-students\" target=\"_blank\">Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Cognition and Academic Scores, Cureus</a>). In addition, research by Gaultney (2017) found that among college students, sleep duration and sleep timing were associated with academic performance measures such as GPA (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10963758.2017.1297713\" target=\"_blank\">Gaultney, 2017</a>). Together, these studies provide evidence that sleep behavior is meaningfully related to academic outcomes, though they differ in how thoroughly they control for other influencing factors. Although the relationship between sleep and academic performance has been studied before, this project does not aim to introduce a new theoretical idea. Instead, it focuses on confirming and extending existing findings using a data science approach and publicly available datasets. Many previous studies do not fully account for prior academic performance, which makes it harder to separate the effect of sleep from a student’s existing ability. By controlling for prior GPA and demographic factors, our analysis examines whether sleep duration remains a meaningful predictor of end-of-semester GPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the specific contribution of sleep to academic success, researchers recommend controlling for prior academic performance and relevant demographic variables. Prior GPA is a strong predictor of future academic outcomes and should be included in analytical models to avoid attributing existing differences in ability to sleep alone. By using regression models that incorporate prior performance and demographic controls, it becomes possible to evaluate whether sleep duration remains a significant predictor of end-of-semester GPA. This project follows that approach by examining the relationship between average nightly sleep duration and semester GPA while accounting for baseline academic performance and demographic factors.\n"

    "We hypothesize that average nightly sleep duration ($TotalSleepTime$) will be a positive and significant predictor of end-of-semester GPA ($term\\_gpa$), such that an increase in sleep duration is associated with higher academic achievement even when controlling for prior performance ($cum\\_gpa$) and demographic factors. This expectation is grounded in the established neurobiological role of sleep in memory consolidation, executive function, and emotional regulation, all of which are critical for the high-level cognitive processing required to succeed in a college environment. By accounting for baseline academic ability and course load, we aim to isolate the specific impact that sleep hygiene has on a student's ability to maintain and improve their grades."

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.

Direct student data collection will require informed consent, which includes a detailed explanation of the study's objectives, the data's purpose, and the fact that participation is entirely voluntary. Participants will be told that participation or non-participation will not have an impact on their academic status.\n",

Also, there may be systematic differences between students who decide to participate and who do not (e.g., more academically engaged kids). The results will be cautiously interpreted, and these limitations will be noted.\n",

    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> Rather than drawing inferences regarding group differences, demographic characteristics are included in order to adjust for confounding effects. Their inclusion helps prevent erroneous findings caused by omitted variable bias and permits investigation of whether observed connections differ between groups.\n",

    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> Data will be stored on secure, access-restricted systems used for academic research. Only authorized members of the research team will have access to the dataset.\n",

    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "> If data are collected directly from participants, individuals will be informed that they may request removal of their data prior to anonymization and analysis.\n",

    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> Instead of generating predictions or making decisions, the model makes use of demographic characteristics, sleep duration, and past GPA for statistical adjustment. Individual-level evaluations are made without the use of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> This study is not primarily concerned with group-level differences. To make sure results are not false, interaction effects and subgroup trends could be investigated descriptively.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",

    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> This research is not meant to be used in situations when decisions must be made. However, there is a risk that results could be misused to blame students or enforce rigid behavioral expectations. Findings will be presented as informative rather than prescriptive, with a focus on wellness-oriented and helpful interpretations, in order to reduce this.\n"
